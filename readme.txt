Note that this API is designed and developed in VS2017.
I have to remove 'packages' folder to limit size of this project so its not compatible with VS 2013.

To run angularapp:
1) Open folder 'anuglarapp' in VS code
2) run 'npm install' to restore packages
3) run -> http-server  It should host application @ http://10.0.0.4:8080
